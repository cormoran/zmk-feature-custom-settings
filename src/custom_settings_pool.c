 * custom_settings_lock. Returns 0 on success or -ENOSPC if the pool cannot fit
 * `needed` bytes for this setting even after compacting every other member;
 * on -ENOSPC nothing is modified - not `setting`, not any other pool
 * member - so the write that requested this region can fail cleanly with the
 * setting's previous value untouched.
 *
 * Deliberately simple: no free lists, no per-region headers, no cached
 * bookkeeping. A region's extent is always derived on the spot from its
 * owning setting's current blob.size, so "compacting" just means walking
 * every OTHER member of this pool (via the pool's own intrusive member list,
 * not the global setting registry - see struct zmk_custom_setting_large_pool),
 * sliding each down (in ascending address order, via memmove, which
 * tolerates the overlapping src/dest this can produce) to eliminate any gap
 * starting at pool->data, and finally handing this setting whatever space is
 * left right after the last one. That happens on every growth, not only when
 * strictly necessary, but pools are expected to hold a handful of members, so
 * this stays cheap and never needs invalidating.
 *
 * Selecting members in ascending address order is done without an
 * intermediate array (repeatedly scanning for the lowest not-yet-processed
 * address) so this has no fixed cap on pool membership. Every member walked
 * here (other than `setting` itself, which may or may not be one yet) is by
 * construction one with blob.data != NULL, since that is the pool's
 * membership invariant - see pool_link_locked/pool_unlink_locked.
